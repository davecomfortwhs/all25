This project demonstrates a turret that maintains aim at a fixed
point on the field, but that can't turn endlessly.  As the robot
base rotates, eventually the turret hits its limit of motion, and
when that happens, the turret spins all the way around to pick
up the target again.

When dancers do this while spinning, it is called "spotting."
