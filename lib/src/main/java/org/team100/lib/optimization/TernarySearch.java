 * Ternary search finds the minimum by testing points. If the function has more
 * than one local minimum, there's no guarantee it will find the global minimum.
 * 
 * It's intended to find the minimum error in each step of coordinate descent,
 * so the function has a scalar input (i.e. configuration of one joint) and a
 * scalar output (i.e. distance).
 * 
 * This partitions equally and evaluates at each point, so it is not fast.
