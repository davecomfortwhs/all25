/**
 * Represents an encoder which is not 1:1 with the mechanism.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: this does not handle rollover, so it can't be used for control.
 * 
 * It may only be used for homing.
 * 
 * If you try to use this for control, the mechanism will behave in unexpected
 * and potentially dangerous ways, as the encoder crosses its zero point.
 * 
 * The intermediate gear goes too fast for rollover support to work -- there are
 * only ~5 ticks per intermediate shaft turn in good conditions, so in "overrun"
 * conditions we could see only a few ticks, and we could easily miss edges.
