/**
 * This uses the approach from LaValle 2023: between any two points in phase
 * space, the optimal acceleration-limited path is via two parabolas, perhaps
 * with a velocity limit.
 * 
 * The notation here is from that paper. Every point in phase space is
 * intersected with two minimum-time parabolas: one corresponding to maximum
 * acceleration, the other to maximum deceleration. The paper was concerned with
 * coordinating multiple axes, so there's a lot in it about non-minimum-time
 * paths. For our purpose here, the simple minimum-time case is all that
 * matters.
 * 
 * The simplest case links a state with zero velocity to another state with
 * position to the right, and also with zero velocity: the result is a
 * symmetrical pair of parabolas, an initial one for acceleration ("I" for
 * "initial") and the second for deceleration to the goal ("G" for "goal"). The
 * intersection is called the "switching point." A path with initial
 * acceleration followed by deceleration to the goal is called "I+G-". The other
 * pairing is also possible, for example the goal could be to the left of the
 * initial state, so the initial acceleration to get there would be negative.
 * 
 * The same picture applies to nonzero-velocity cases, and to cases with
 * velocities of opposite sign: any two states can be linked by either an I+G-
 * or I-G+ path.
 * 
 * Adding a velocity limit means that the "switching point" may be clipped off,
 * so the path is something like I+CG-, "C" for "cruise."
 * 
 * So there are three kinds of boundaries: I-G, I-cruise, and cruise-G.
 * 
 * https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01744.pdf
 * 
 * This class is different from the WPI profile class -- it keeps no state, it
 * just takes one dt step at a time. It doesn't have the notion of a profile
 * being "completed" -- if you want that, compare the output to the goal. The
 * main benefit of the approach here is that it correctly handles cases
 * involving moving end states that the WPI code does not handle correctly.
 * 
 * It might be slower around the switching points, since it can call itself once
 * or twice, once per segment.
 * 
 * Oct 3 2024, a new requirement is to compute the profile duration, for the
 * purpose of coordinating multiple profiles. In general, this sort of
 * coordination is complicated, involving three different "switching point"
 * possibilities, but for the goal-at-rest case, there's just one ("x_switch"
 * from the paper) and i think you can just scale the constraints. For an
 * implementation of the general case, see team100/studies2023/rrt, specifically
 * the RRTStar classes, which include coordination in their path solvers.
 * 
 * note: both the wpi and 100 profiles fail to produce useful feedforward when
 * the distance is reachable in one time step, i.e. high accel and velocity
 * limits.
