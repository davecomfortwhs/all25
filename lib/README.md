# Team 100 Library

The library mostly code that isn't specific to a specific game or year.

There might be some specific parts included as examples, but year-specific
code should generally go in the comp or studies directories.

There are useful README's throughout the code.  A good place to
start would be the
[lib package README](src/main/java/org/team100/lib/README.md).

There is also a [doc directory](doc/README.md).
